 Endometriosis Diagnosis Using a Voting Classifier (SVM, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree)
 
 Overview
 
Endometriosis is a chronic condition affecting millions of women globally, often causing pain and infertility. Accurate diagnosis is essential yet remains challenging. This project leverages machine learning to build a robust diagnostic model using a Voting Classifier that combines the strengths of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and Decision Tree classifiers to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability.

Objective
 
The primary aim is to improve clinical diagnosis of endometriosis by:

Reducing diagnostic delays

Increasing prediction accuracy

Combining multiple ML models to make more reliable decisions
